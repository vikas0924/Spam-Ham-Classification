# Spam-Ham-Classification

Spam email is a common problem that plagues inboxes around the world. In this project, we will develop a machine learning model that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to accurately classify emails as either spam or ham. The project involves using a dataset of labeled emails to train a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of an email being spam.

The importance of spam filtering cannot be overstated. Spam emails can be more than just annoying; they can contain malicious links, phishing scams, and other harmful content. By using machine learning to automatically filter out spam emails, we can help prevent users from falling victim to scams and other online threats.

The project will involve several key steps, including preprocessing the text data by removing stop words and stemming or lemmatizing the words, and transforming the text into a numerical representation using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings. We will then build and train a machine learning model on the preprocessed data, and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy and F1 score.

The trained model will be deployed in a web application that can classify new emails in real-time. The application can help email providers and individuals alike keep their inboxes organized and free of spam, thereby reducing the risk of harmful attacks and making email communication more efficient.

Overall, the Spam/Ham Classifier project is a valuable tool for anyone who relies on email communication, and its importance in filtering out harmful content cannot be overstated.
